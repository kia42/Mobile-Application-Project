Repository for COM437 App Development Project

## Initial Thoughts
Brainstorming an IOS Mobile App that gives user's food and restaurant suggestions based on their search and browsing history. 
I would love to try and Implement AI, for instance having a section in the app that uses Chat GPT. The AI software would answer the user's question of "What should I eat today?" or "What's the best thing for me to eat today"
I would like the app to not only be a form of feedback, but also want to add calorie tracking in order to synchronize with the question's above. Whether a user is currently on a diet, or bulking in the gym. I'd like the app to be versatile for multiple users, especially for those with dietary restrictions. 

## Project Description
Overview: Snack Buddy, Is a AI influenced user application. It is designed to give suggestions to user on what they should eat. Whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a snack. The user can fully customize their Buddy to give them suggestions based on their user profile and dietary restrictions. 
Target Audience: This app is targeted towards the younger population who may have difficulty switching up their food choices in the day, or those who simply need to change routine. This app can be utilized by users of all ages 17+. 

### Features
* Personalized Home/User Screen
* Calorie & Water Tracking
* In App Food Suggestions (mileage, store times incl.)
* In App Recipe Suggestions

## Addressing Conflicts
* Dietary Regulations: For those with dietary regulations the app would assist those in avoiding foods that aren't good for them. Giving them a peace of mind
* Food Tracking: This app goes beyond the typical calorie tracking app and allows user's to implement personal preferences, this ensure's that every suggestion is catered to the user's likes.
* Indecisiveness: Many users (like myself) often ponder what they want to eat, or want to start dieting or try a different food lifestyle. This will assist those who want to try something new, but may not know where to start. This will also assist those with food allergens and restrictions.
